There is a large coffee shop chain, who want to expand their loyalty program by including product discounts and targeted advertising. For this they require a deeper understanding of their customer base and their customersâ€™ buying patterns. They have provided some transaction data for us to review and make initial recommendations.

The following questions were considered in my data analysis:
<br/> 1) What kinds of products generate the most sales?
<br/> 2) What kinds of customers generate the most sales? Can you explain why?
<br/> 3) Which segment of its customer base should the company target a marketing campaign towards?

The dataset originally comes from IBM and more information is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ylchang/coffee-shop-sample-data-1113
